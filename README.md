This is a repository of my old, high school (2017-2021) Computer Science projects, which include extensive Java, Android, and Unity development. It's now used for reference and the occasional trip down memory lane.

Below, I've included the main concepts that I learned in each course.

## Introduction to Computer Science - Java

* The main method
* Variables and data types
* Math operators and the Math class
* Strings and String methods
* Conditional statements
  * If-else statements
  * Switch statements
* Arrays
* For, while, and do/while loops
  * Nested loops
* Scanner
* Methods
* Selection and insertion sorting algorithms
* Binary search

## AP Computer Science A - Java

* ArrayList
* Recursion
* Object-oriented Programming
* Interfaces
* Static variables
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference
* GridWorld case study
* Version control using GitHub Desktop
* Game development using JavaFX

## Mobile Application Development - Java, Android Studio

* The activity lifecycle
* Activities
* Linear, Relative, and Constraint layouts
